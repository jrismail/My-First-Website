            <p>Life struggle refers to the experiences and

            <ul>
                <li>Internal Struggles: These are conflicts within oneself, such as self-doubt, fear, or personal
                    limitations.</li>
                <li>External Struggles: These involve challenges posed by the external environment, such as financial
                    difficulties, health issues, or relationship problems.</li>
